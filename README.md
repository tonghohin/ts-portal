## Features

- **Announcement Board** - Superintendents can post announcements on the portal and the tenants will be able to read them after loggin in to the portal.
- **Private Message** - Tenants can leave private messages to superintendents and superintendents can manage all the received messages on the portal.
- **Gymroom Registration** - Tenants can use the portal for registering access to the gymroom.
- **Different Access Rights** - React Router is used for routing users with different access rights to different pages, e.g. tenants would not be able to see the superintendents' page.
- **Authentication** - JSON Web Tokens is used for handling authentication. Users are authenticated when they login. Unauthenticated users will not be able to access the portal.
