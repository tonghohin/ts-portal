# Tenant Potal

This is a portal designed for making communications between tenants and superintendents easier.

See the JavaScript version here: https://github.com/tonghohin/portal

## Features

- **Tenant Database** - Superintendents are able to read, add, update or delete any tenants from the database.
- **Announcement Board** - Superintendents can post announcements on the portal and the tenants will be able to read them after loggin in to the portal.
- **Private Message** - Tenants can leave private messages to superintendents and superintendents can manage all the received messages on the portal.
- **Gymroom Registration** - Tenants can use the portal for registering access to the gymroom.
- **Different Access Rights** - React Router is used for routing users with different access rights to different pages, e.g. tenants would not be able to see the superintendents' page.
- **Authentication** - JSON Web Tokens is used for handling authentication. Users are authenticated when they login. Unauthenticated users will not be able to access the portal.
- **User Accounts** - Both tenants and superintendents have to register an account and use the credentials for future login. The user credentials are store in a MongoDB database with the passwords encrypted.
